# Terraform-EC2-ASG

In my learning of AWS and Terraform, following the completion of my Hashicorp Terraform Associate Certification, I have included some segments of the code I used to build up my understanding of Terraform. In this project I have attempted to write my code in accordance to terraform best practices. The current Terraform infrastructure supports an autoscaling EC2 instance configured with subnets and a load balancer that will perform health checks on my ASG, in addition there is a backend S3 bucket configured for the storage and state locking fo the state file.
